## Model Predictive Control

#### Theory

Let's assume we have already known the waypoints as the place we should go after path planning. Control algorithm as the next part should make the car follow those waypoints. 
The model predictive control here summarize the movement of the car as a kinematic model. In kinematic model, (x,y,psi,v,cte,epsi) is the state of the car for every time step, 
the actuators are the throttle and steer value as (a, delta). If we know the current state and the value of actuator we want to use, we can predict the next state by applying 
kinematic model motion equation. Since we already know the waypoints we should follow, we can calculate the error between the next state we predict and the waypoints we should follow. 
The final goal of model predictive control is reducing this error with a optimizer. Then, we just need to apply the optimal actuator to achieve the control goal.

#### Experiment

From the view of optimization, we should set the cost and constrain. Here, I firstly considered cross track error and orientation error. Then, I added the power of actuators and 
the power of the change of the actuators, since I don't want the car change speed or orientation too fast. Next, I don't want the car have a sharp turning while driving in high speed, so 
I also penalized speed*steer. Finally, I added (v-v_ref)**2 into cost function to make the car can follow the reference speed.

#### Parameter Tuning 

I started with N=10 and dt=0.1. Fortunately, this combination gave me a very good performance. So I just kept those two values.
A smaller dt means a finer resolution, the model can perform better for a small time interval.
Larger N can involve more time steps but the computational burdern is also larger, so the N can not be neither too large nor too small. 
The time horizon over speed (N*dt)/speed decide the reacting time for the change of the road status, it can not be too small.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
